Health Checklist
With the new Health Checklist, it’s easier than ever to manage the health features that matter most to you. In one central place, you can track and manage your health and safety features, see whether they’re enabled on your iPhone and Apple Watch, turn them on from the checklist, and see when they were last updated.
